# Contact Form Integration Test

## What's Been Implemented

✅ **EmailJS Integration**: The contact form now uses EmailJS to send emails instead of just simulating submission.

✅ **Environment Configuration**: Added environment variables for:
- `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` - Your EmailJS service ID
- `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` - Your EmailJS template ID  
- `VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` - Your EmailJS public key
- `VITE_CONTACT_RECEIVE_EMAIL` - The email address where you want to receive contact form submissions

✅ **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling with user-friendly messages

✅ **Toast Notifications**: Integrated react-toastify for success/error notifications

✅ **Form Validation**: Maintains existing form validation using react-hook-form

## How to Test

### 1. Set up EmailJS (Required)
Follow the instructions in `EMAILJS_SETUP.md` to:
- Create an EmailJS account
- Set up an email service

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your EmailJS credentials:

```env
VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_service_id
VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_template_id
VITE_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VITE_CONTACT_RECEIVE_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

### 3. Test the Form
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/contact`
3. Fill out the contact form
4. Submit and verify:
   - Success toast notification appears
